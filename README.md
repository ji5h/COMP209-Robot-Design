A robotic art piece that shows how agency of the individual is imperative to the improvemnt of the environment and challenges conventional perceptions of waste disposal. It starts conversations about sustainability and encourages individuals to rethink their relationship with the environment. Through its anthropomorphic design, the user is enticed to interact with it, witnessing firsthand the impact of their actions on the environment.
